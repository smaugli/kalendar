Mitteformaalne.ee old event calendar documentation

Coded in Zend Frameweork. Code is not struturable. It's fully overridden the MVC and zend architecture. For example the each and every form should be handled by zend but it's breaked.

There are 3 types of users: "organisations" and "teachers". Both can add training events to the calendar that "admin user" must activate before they appear in calendar. Also there are of course unregistered users.

***Unregistered users***
Users that can see events in calendar and teachers’ and organisations’ profiles. They can register themselves to events when event has registration form.

***Calendar frontpage***
http://mitteformaalne.ee/kalendar 
1.	At the very top right corner there’s "Otsi koolitust kogu kalendrist" search box to search for a training event from Ahole calendar.
2.	Main area where you see one month. In the boxes there are titles of the training events that are in that day and below title the date of that event. One event can b eduring multiple days so it will appear in many days in calendar.
3.	Below "Otsi koolitajat" search box to search for a teacher account. Search for example for string "kaspar" and you’ll find one teacher.
4.	At the very bottom "Otsi organisatsiooni" search box to search for a organisation. Type there string "kool" for example to see search results.

After you click submit button next page will load and all information that is filled in here will be displayed under the teacher’s profile page for all unregistered users. You don’t need to understand what are the input fields in Estonian language as lorem ipsum information you input here will be just displayed under profile page with same tites.
When you click submit there then you’ll be taken automatically to your teacher’s admin panel.
